# Assignment 1 ReadMe

This project is a terminal version of the Spanish card game Siete y Medio, conceptually similar to 
Blackjack but using a Spanish deck known as a *baraja*. This deck is different from a conventional
deck in that there are only 10 cards of each house: 7 numbered cards and three face cards. The game
itself differs from Blackjack in that the face cards are only worth half a point each and the aim is 
to get as close to seven and a half points as possible without going over.

### Further Comments

When I initially created the git repo for this assignment, I did so through Visual Studios 2017. As a 
result, the solution files, various project files, and .gitignore and .gitattributes files were
automatically added to the repository without my knowledge. Unbeknownst to me, they remained in the
repository but were never updated until I published my repository onto GitHub. I cleared out the files
unique to Visual Studios, but kept the .gitignore and .gitattributes in the published repository.
